<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What is Amadeus for Developers?</h3>

<p>Amadeus for Developers is a new open innovation program aiming to facilitate innovation and speed up the exploration of new ideas. In the context of the program, we have built a new <a href="https://developers.amadeus.com/">portal</a> and a new catalog of easy-to-use REST/JSON APIs.</p>

<p>The new Amadeus for Developers <a href="https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service">Self-Service APIs</a> have been specifically designed to meet the needs of startups, independent developers and other innovators. They will benefit from:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Documentation publicly available in the portal.</li>
	<li>Free test environment, accessible in less than 3 minutes.</li>
	<li>Pay-as-you-go payment system.</li>
	<li>Access to production data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why is Amadeus for Developers relevant for me?</h3>

<p>The Self-Service API catalog offers similar functionalities as the Travel Innovation Sandbox with APIs, such as Flight Low-Fare Search, and Nearest Relevant Airport. However they are not backwards compatible, which means you will have to refactor your code if you wish to connect to Amadeus for Developers APIs.</p>

<p>This catalog with will see new, regular releases covering different stages of the travel lifecycle. Furthermore Amadeus for Developers includes a Hotel Search API which was previously discontinued in the Travel Innovation Sandbox.</p>

<p>Unlike the Travel Innovation Sandbox, designed for testing and prototyping purposes only, with the new Amadeus for Developers<a href="https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service"> Self-Service APIs</a> you can also get access to production data and build commercial applications.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3>

<h4>Why is the Travel Innovation Sandbox being decommissioned?</h4>

<p>The Travel Innovation Sandbox has allowed thousand of developers to build prototypes with Amadeus APIs. Now, with Amadeus for Developers, Amadeus will improve the collaboration with innovators and developers not only to help them build new prototypes but to launch their apps to the market. With the objective of speeding up innovation for every developer around the world, the new open portal brings additional tools and features to make it easier to connect to all Amadeus travel data and functionalities.</p>

<h4>What are the benefits of switching over to Amadeus for Developers?</h4>

<p>Unlike the Travel Innovation Sandbox APIs, which were designed for testing and prototyping purposes only, the new Self-Service APIs offered via the new Amadeus for Developers portal give you the opportunity to create commercial applications. Self-Service APIs include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>A<b> Test environment</b>that you can access instantly to build and test your applications. Just as in the Travel Innovation Sandbox, you will enjoy a limited number of free monthly calls for each API. Some limitations in the data may apply.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A<b> Production environment</b> that you can seamlessly access to. Here you will access production data and benefit from unlimited API calls, with a simple pay-as-you-go pricing. By switching over to Amadeus for Developers you can also enjoy other benefits, such as:</p>
		<li>A developer workspace where you can monitor your use of the APIs and get relevant analytics to help you manage your applications.</li>
		<li>Additional resources, such as SDKs, code examples and tutorials.</li>
		<li>A Developers Blog to keep you updated with the latest news about tech trends, hackathons and events, and Amadeus for Developers community.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How can I switch over to the Amadeus for Developers portal?</h4>

<p>The easiest way to switch over to Amadeus for Developers is to simply follow our <a href="https://developers.amadeus.com/quick-start-guide">Get Started Guide</a>. You will find step by step instructions on how to set up your account, get your API key, make your first call and how to <a href="https://github.com/amadeus4dev/developer-guides/blob/master/guides/production.md">move to production</a>.</p>

<p>Remember, even if you find the same APIs in Self-Service, you will need to refactor your code, as the APIs are not backwards compatible.</p>

<h4>Do I need to pay to switch to Amadeus for Developers?</h4>

<p>No, you do not need to pay to switch to the Self-Service offer. You can register to Amadeus for Developers and start testing the Self-Service APIs free of charge, with a maximum number of monthly calls for each API (some data limitations may apply, but your free monthly calls should be enough for testing purposes). Once you have tested your application and you are ready to launch it to the market, you can easily get access to production data in just a few hours. You will still benefit from some free monthly calls, and once you reach a certain threshold you will start to pay only for what you use (no additional setup, monthly or hidden fees apply). Check our <a href="https://developers.amadeus.com/pricing">pricing page</a> to find out more about pricing conditions for Self-Service APIs.</p>

<h4>Will Amadeus for Developers offer the same APIs as the Innovation Sandbox?</h4>

<p>The Amadeus for Developers Self-Service APIs, includes some APIs similar to the ones offered in the Travel Innovation Sandbox, such as Flight Inspiration Search, Flight Low-fare Search, and Nearest Airport Search. These APIs are alike in function. However, they are not backwards compatible, which means you will have to refactor your code if you wish to switch over to the new Amadeus for Developers APIs.</p>

<p>Some APIs, such as Rail are not available in Amadeus for Developers for the time being. However the API catalog will expand as the program matures, if you cannot find the API you want, we encourage you to keep an eye out for future releases.</p>
