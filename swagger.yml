      summary: Flight Inspiration Search - Go beyond the traditional search by origin, destination and dates to meet the needs of travelers looking for suggestions and a search experience that reflects the way they choose their trip. This can help you answer the question "Where can I go within a given travel budget?" 
      description: |
        <p>The Inspiration Flight Search allows you to find the prices of one-way and return flights from an origin city without necessarily having a destination, or even a flight date, in mind. The search doesn't return a distinct set of price options, but rather, can tell you the price of flying from a given city to some destination, for a trip of a given duration, that falls within a given date range.</p>

        <p>The search is based on our Extreme Search platform, which continually caches a large number of flight search results from a list of origin cities to a variety of destinations. Since it's a cached search, the response time is fast, but not all origin airports are available. Here is <a href="https://github.com/amadeus-travel-innovation-sandbox/sandbox-content/blob/master/flight-search-cache-origin-destination.csv">a list of the currently supported origin-destination IATA location pairs</a>. We try to keep this list as fresh as possible for you, but be aware that it may not always be exactly up-to-date and it can change without warning.</p>

        <p>Despite this limitation don't underestimate the power of this API. Thanks to its quick response speed you can easily pair it with other APIs to provide a low fare and inspiration for any destination. For example, you can could combine it with a event search API and suggest a total price to see go and see an concert or a game in a selection of cities.</p>

      summary: Flight Extensive Search - Build travel searches based on very flexible and open range of dates. You can use it to answer questions such as "When is the best date to fly...".  It's built on Amadeus' Featured Results technology, which returns thousands of results (prices, itineraries and dates) in a matter of milliseconds. Results are available over half a calendar year with a 1 to 15 day stay duration
      description: |
        <p>The Extensive Flight Search allows you to find the prices of one-way or return flights between two airports over a large number of dates, and for a large variety of stay durations. The search doesn't return exact itineraries, but rather tells you the best price for a flight on a given day, for a stay of a given duration.</p>

        <p>The search is based on our Extreme Search platform, which continually caches a large number of flight search results from a list of origin cities to a variety of destinations. Since it's a cached search, the response time is fast, but not all origin airports are available.

        <p>That said, a price graph like this provides a powerful bargin shopping tool - allowing travelers with flexible itineraries to identify days on which they can get the cheapest flights to their destinations.</p>

      summary: Airport Autocomplete - Find an IATA location code for flight search based on a city or airport name using the term parameter. By only using the country parameter, this API is also able to find all the IATA location codes associated with a country. Both term and country parameters can be used together to filter the results accordingly. The API is fully JQuery-Autocomplete compatible to enable you to quickly build a drop-down list for your users to find the right airport easily.

        <p>Using the term parameter and given the start of any word in an airport's official name, a city name, or the start of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_airport_code">IATA code</a>, this API provides the full name and IATA location code of the city or airport, for use in flight searches. Only major cities and civilian airports with several commercial flights per week are included by default. The response provides up to 20 possible matches, sorted by importance, in a <a href="http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/">JQuery UI Autocomplete</a> compatible format. <a href="https://github.com/amadeus-travel-innovation-sandbox/sandbox-content/blob/master/airport-autocomplete-template.html">This sample implementation</a> using JQuery UI may help.

      description: |
        <p>This service gives the most relevant airports in a radius of 500 km around the given coordinates. The relevance of an airport is computed by dividing the number of airport movements (take offs and landings) by the distance from the point. This causes the relevance of an airport to increase exponentially as you approach it.</p>

        <p>To minimize response time, all distances are computed as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance">great-circle distance</a> from the provided coordinates to the airport coordinates, and thus do not take into account traffic conditions, international boundaries, mountains, water, or other elements that might make the a nearby airport hard to reach.</p>

        <p>Only civilian airports with at least several commercial flights per week are included in the results.</p>

        <p>The result is a list of airports sorted by decreasing relevance. It always contains the nearest airport with significant commercial traffic.

        <p>A fast Hotel shopping API to see which hotels are available in a given area, on a given day and displays their lowest prices. With this API you can find out the price of the cheapest daily rate for all hotels within a specified geographical region.</p>
        
        <p>This API allows you to quickly see the hotel locations in a region, and what prices in that area look like,  as well as the check-in and check-out dates, and get a list of up to 140 properties (names, codes, image, amenities) with their locations and rates. Optional parameters such as currency and maximum rates, amenities or hotel chain codes are also available and can be used to narrow down the results. More optional parameters such as show_sold_out & rooms can be used to show sold out rooms and all available rooms.</p>
                    
        <p>The API is based on our high-speed hotel pricing cache, which is also used to power the <a href="https://hotelsearchengine.amadeus.com/">Amadeus Hotel Search Engine</a> application. Results are returned very quickly, response times are generally under 2s. Our cache has great global coverage and is constantly refreshed with the latest prices.</p>
